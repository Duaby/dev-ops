# DevOps Stack Setup with Docker

This project helps you set up a basic DevOps stack using Docker and Docker Compose. The stack runs multiple services in isolated containers. Each service has its own role and communicates through a shared Docker network.

---

## Purpose

This project helps you learn how to build, run, and manage a DevOps environment on your local machine. You use real tools found in production systems. You practice how to start, stop, and connect databases through Docker. You also understand how DevOps integrates with infrastructure automation and software delivery.

---

## What is Ops

Ops means managing software after it is built. It covers deployment, infrastructure setup, monitoring, and incident response.

Ops tasks include:

* Deploying applications to servers
* Managing network and storage
* Monitoring logs and performance
* Handling system updates
* Ensuring uptime and security

---

## What is DevOps

DevOps connects development and operations. It promotes collaboration and automation across both sides. The goal is faster delivery and more stable systems.

Core principles:

* Automate builds and deployments
* Use version control for infrastructure
* Integrate and test continuously
* Monitor systems and use feedback to improve
* Break down silos between teams

---

## What is Docker

Docker packages applications and their dependencies into containers. Containers run the same on any system that supports Docker. This makes setup faster and environments consistent.

---

## How Docker Works

* **Dockerfile** defines how to build an image
* **Image** is a template with app code and dependencies
* **Container** is a running instance of an image
* **Docker Engine** runs containers and manages networking
* **Docker Compose** defines and starts multiple containers together

---

## What are Containers

A container is an isolated environment that runs an application with all required libraries and tools. Containers are small, fast, and portable. They help prevent conflicts between environments and reduce setup time.

---

## Project Overview

This stack uses Docker Compose to manage three key database services:

1. **InfluxDB** for time-series data
2. **PostgreSQL** for relational data
3. **Cassandra** for NoSQL workloads

Each service runs in its own container. They share a Docker network so they can communicate securely. Data is stored in persistent volumes.

---

## Services Explained

### InfluxDB (Time-Series Database)

* Image: `influxdb:2.7`
* Port: `8086`
* Use: Store time-series data for metrics and logs
* Data: Saved in `influxdb_data` volume

### PostgreSQL (Relational Database)

* Image: `postgres:15`
* Port: `5432`
* Use: Store structured data like users, transactions, and metadata
* Data: Saved in `postgres_data` volume

### Cassandra (NoSQL Database)

* Image: `cassandra:4.1`
* Port: `9042`
* Use: Handle large-scale data with high read and write speed
* Data: Saved in `cassandra_data` volume

---

## System Requirements

* Docker 24.0 or newer
* Docker Compose plugin
* Minimum 4 GB RAM
* Stable internet connection for pulling images

---

## Running the Stack

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duaby/dev-ops.git  
cd dev-ops
```

### Step 2: Start the Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command pulls images, creates containers, and sets up volumes.

### Step 3: Wait for Initialization

* InfluxDB: 1–2 minutes
* PostgreSQL: 30 seconds
* Cassandra: 1–2 minutes

Check progress:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### Step 4: Access the Services

* InfluxDB: [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086) (user: admin / password: admin123)
* PostgreSQL: Port 5432 (user: postgres / password: postgres123 / db: mydb)
* Cassandra: Port 9042

### Step 5: Verify Functionality

* InfluxDB: Log in and create a bucket
* PostgreSQL: Run `SELECT version();`
* Cassandra: Run `DESCRIBE CLUSTER;`

---

## Stopping the Stack

Stop containers but keep data.

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

Stop and remove everything.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Remove all volumes.

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* Ensure ports 8086, 5432, and 9042 are free
* Use `sudo` if Docker needs root access
* Wait for images to download fully
* Recreate volumes if data corruption occurs

### View Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs influxdb
docker-compose logs postgres
docker-compose logs cassandra
docker-compose logs
```

### Reset Everything

```bash
docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Usage Examples

### InfluxDB

Write and query data from the UI or API.
Example query in UI:

```
from(bucket: "metrics") |> range(start: -1h)
```

### PostgreSQL

Connect with psql.

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d mydb
```

Example query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));
```

### Cassandra

Connect with cqlsh.

```bash
cqlsh localhost 9042
```

Example command:

```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
```
